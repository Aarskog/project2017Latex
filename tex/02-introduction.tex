\section{Motivation}
To properly control and model a robot arm a lot of mathematics is involved and one need to do a bit of testing to see if the mathematical model is right. But most of all it is very usefull to have a simulation environment when one are testing different controllers and testing out different controller gains. If one are to test on the real system it is very possible that the robot arm or other equipment can get destroyed. If a simulation environment is created this risk disappears and one can do proper testing quicker and more efficient without having to think about all these risks. \\ \\
It was also wanted to include a camera at the tip of the robotarm and to do steer the robot arm based on the outputs of this camera therefore a good controller and a simple motion planner is wanted as well.

(I guess robots have been simulated before)
\subsection{Control}
(What are the most used controllers at the moment?)
