\chapter{Kinematics}
As we already know the robot can be represented as a kinematic chain of links and connected by revolute joints. In this chapter the forward kinematics for this robotic manipulator is calculated and a method for solving the inverse kinematics is proposed. 

\section{Forward Kinematics}
The forward kinematics states the relationship between the end effector and the individual joints. Or as \cite{Siciliano} says it: The motion of the structure is obtained by composition of the elementary motions of each link with respect to the previous one. An easy way to get the forward kinematics is to use the Denavit-Hartenberg(DH) convention. \cite{spong} states that each homogeneous transformation $A_i$ is represented as a product of four basic transformations: 

$$
A_i = \text{Rot}_{z,\theta_i}\text{Trans}_{z,d_i}\text{Trans}_{x,a_i}\text{Rot}_{x,\alpha_i}=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        c_{\theta_i} & -s_{\theta_i}c_{\alpha_i} & s_{\theta_i}s_{\alpha_i} & a_ic_{\theta_i}\\
        s_{\theta_i} & c_{\theta_i}c_{\alpha_i} & -c_{\theta_i}s_{\alpha_i} & a_is_{\theta_i}\\
        0 & s_{\alpha_i} & c_{\alpha_i} &d_i\\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
$$

where $c_{\theta_i} = \cos{(\theta_i)}$ and $s_{\theta_i} = \sin{(\theta_i)}$, and the same for $\alpha$. $A_i$ is a transformation matrix which states the transformation between link number $i$ and link number $i-1$. This means that it is possilbe to get the transformation from the robot base to the end effector by multiplying each transformation matrix:
\begin{align*}
    T^i_j = A_{i+1}A_{i+2}...A_j, \quad i<j
\end{align*}
 $T^i_j$ states the transformation between each link and it has the form
 \begin{align*}
      T^i_j = 
      \begin{bmatrix}
          R^i_j & o^i_j\\
          0&1
      \end{bmatrix}, \quad i<j
 \end{align*}
 where $R^i_j = R^i_{i+1}R...R^{j-1}_j$ which is the orientation of $o_jx_jy_jz_j$ relative to $o_ix_iy_iz_i$. $o^i_j$ is the coordinate vector which can be written as $o^i_j = o^i_{j-1}+R^{i}_{j-1}o^{j-1}_j$. This is useful when finding the Jacobian of the robot and to verify that the end effector is at the wanted position and has the wanted orientation in the Cartesian world frame. When finding the DH-parameters they have to satisfy the two following properties (\cite{spong}).
 \begin{itemize}
     \item The axis $x_n$ is perpendicular to the axis $z_{n-1}$
     \item The axis $x_n$ intersects the axis $z_{n-1}$
 \end{itemize}

In \figref{fig:dhf} the different axis are set with respect to the DH properties stated above.

\end{figure}

By looking at \figref{fig:dhf} the following DH parameters are found:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
         \hline
         Link & $a_i$ & $\alpha_i$ & $d_i$ & $\theta_i$ \\ \hline
         1 & 0 & $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ & $d_1$ & $q_1$ \\
         2 & $a_2$ & 0 & 0 & $q_2$ \\ 
         3 & $a_3$ & 0 & 0 & $q_3$\\
         4 & 0 & $\frac{\pi}{2}$ & 0 & $q_4$\\
         5 & 0 & 0 & $d_5$ & $q_5$\\
         \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

% d_1 = 0.0506
% a_2 = 0.0506 + 0.0206 + 0.0635 = 0.1347
% a_3 = 0.0506 + 0.0206 = 0.0712
% d_5 = 0.0506 + 0.0206 + 0.0253 + 0.08 = 0.1765

where $d_1 = 0.0506$, $a_2 = 0.1347$, $a_3 = 0.0712$ and $d_5 = 0.1765$ for the model. The real values need to be measured properly since the data sheet of the robot is insufficient and this is just guesstimated values. 
Now it is possible to calculate $A_i$ for each link: 
\begin{align*}
A_1 &= \begin{bmatrix} 
            c_1 & 0 & -s_1 & 0\\
            s_1 & 0 & c_1 & 0\\
            0 & -1 & 0 & d_1\\
            0 & 0 & 0 & 1
        \end{bmatrix},
A_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 
            c_2 & -s_2 & 0 & a_2c_2\\
            s_2 & c_2 & 0 & a_2s_2\\
            0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
            0 & 0 & 0 & 1
        \end{bmatrix},
A_3 = \begin{bmatrix} 
            c_3 & -s_3 & 0 & a_3c_3\\
            s_3 & c_3 & 0 & a_3s_3\\
            0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
            0 & 0 & 0 & 1
        \end{bmatrix}\\
A_4 &= \begin{bmatrix} 
            c_4 & 0 & s_4 & 0\\
            s_4 & 0 & -s_4 & 0\\
            0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
            0 & 0 & 0 & 1
        \end{bmatrix},
A_5 = \begin{bmatrix} 
            c_5 & -s_5 & 0 & 0\\
            s_5 & c_5 & 0 & 0\\
            0 & 0 & 1 & d_5 \\
            0 & 0 & 0 & 1
        \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
 and then calculate $T_i^0$:

    \begin{align}
        T_1^0 &= A_1 =
        \begin{bmatrix}\label{eq:T1}

\subsection{Direct kinematics}
(Just a smaller representation of the forward kinematics)

\subsection{Jacobian}
As we already know the forward kinematics can be written as:
\begin{align*}
    T(q) = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        R(q) & p(q)\\
        0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
we want to express the linear velocity $\dot{p}$ and angular velocity $\omega$ as a function of the joint velocities $\dot{q}$. In \cite{Siciliano} the relations is stated as:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}\label{eq:velo}
        \dot{p} &= J_P(q)\dot{q}\\
        \omega&= J_O(q)\dot{q}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $J_O$ with dimensions (3 $\times$ n) is the relation between the joint velocities $\dot{q}$ and the end-effector linear velocity $\dot{p}$, and the (3 $\times$ n) matrix $J_O$ is the relation between the joint velocities $\dot{q}$ and the end-effector angular velocity $\omega$. \eqref{eq:velo} can be written as

\begin{align*}
    v_e = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \dot{p} \\ \omega
    \end{bmatrix}
    = J(q)\dot{q}
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
    J = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        J_P \\ J_O
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

which is the matrix that \cite{Siciliano} calls the geometric Jacobian. The elements of 
$$
J = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    j_{P1} & & j_{Pn}\\
    &...&\\
    j_{O1} & & j_{On}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
can be calculated in the following way:
\begin{align*}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        j_{Pi}\\j_{Oi}
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{cases}
        \begin{bmatrix} z_{i-1}\\ 0 \end{bmatrix} & \text{for a prismatic joint}\\
        \begin{bmatrix} z_{i-1} \times (p_e-p_{i-1}) \\ z_{i-1} \end{bmatrix} & \text{for a revolute joint}
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}

Since our manipulator only has revolute joints, the geometric Jacobian becomes

\begin{align*}
    J(q) = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        z_0 \times (p_5-p_0) & 
        z_1 \times (p_5-p_1) & 
        z_2 \times (p_5-p_2) & 
        z_3 \times (p_5-p_3) & 
        z_4 \times (p_5-p_4) \\
        z_0 &
        z_1 &
        z_2 &
        z_3 &
        z_4
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
From when the forward kinematics were calculated each position vector $p_i$ can be directly obtained from the equations \eqref{eq:T1} - \eqref{eq:T5}:



\begin{align*}
    p_0 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}    \quad
    p_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ d_1\end{bmatrix}    \quad
    p_2 = \begin{bmatrix} a_2c_1c_2\\ a_2s_1c_2\\ d_1 - a_2s_2\end{bmatrix}   \quad 
    p_3 = \begin{bmatrix} c_1(a_3c_{23} + a_2c_2) \\ s_1(a_3c_{23} + a_2c_2) \\ d_1 - a_3s_{23}-a_2s_2 \end{bmatrix}  \\  
    p_4 = \begin{bmatrix} c_1(a_3c_{23} + a_2c_2) \\ s_1(a_3c_{23} + a_2c_2) \\ d_1 - a_3s_{23}-a_2s_2\end{bmatrix}  \quad  
    p_5 = \begin{bmatrix} c_1(a_3c_{23} + a_2c_2 + d_5s_{234}) \\ s_1(a_3c_{23} + a_2c_2 + d_5s_{234}) \\ d_1 - a_3s_{23} - a_2s_2 + d_5c_{234} \end{bmatrix}    
\end{align*}

The next step is to find $z_{i-1}$. \cite{Siciliano} states that $z_{i-1}$ is given by the third column of the rotation matrix $R_{i-1}^0$. $R_{i-1}^0$ is already given in $T_i^0$, By looking at \eqref{eq:T1} - \eqref{eq:T5} the following values of $z_{i-1}$ is given:
\begin{align*}
    z_0 &= \begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\1\end{bmatrix},
    z_1 = \begin{bmatrix}-s_1\\c_1\\0\end{bmatrix},
    z_2 = \begin{bmatrix}-s_1\\c_1\\0\end{bmatrix},
    z_3 = \begin{bmatrix}-s_1\\c_1\\0\end{bmatrix},
    z_4 = \begin{bmatrix}c_1s_{234}\\s_1s_{234}\\c_{234}\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

now we got everything needed to compute the geometric Jacobian and the result is presented below.


\begin{align*}
    J(q) &= \\
    &\begin{bmatrix}
        -s_1(a_3c_{23} + a_2c_{2} + d_5s_{234}) & 
        -c_1(a_3s_{23} + a_2s_{2} - d_5c_{234}) & 
        -c_1(a_3s_{23} - d_5c_{234})            & 
        c_1d_5c_{234}                           & 
        0\\
        c_1(a_3c_{23} + a_2c_{2} + d_5s_{234})  & 
        -s_1(a_3s_{23} + a_2s_{2} - d_5c_{234}) & 
        -s_1(a_3s_{23} - d_5c_{234})            & 
        s_1d_5c_{234}                           & 
        0\\
        0                                       &
        -a_3c_{23}- a_2c_2 - d_5s_{234}         &
        -a_3c_{23} - d_5s_{234}                 &
        -d_5s_{234}                             &
        0\\
        0                                       &
        -s_1                                    &
        -s_1                                    &
        -s_1                                    &
        c_1s_{234}\\
        0                                       &
        c_1&
        c_1&
        c_1&
        s_1s_{234}\\
        1& 0 & 0 & 0 & c_{234}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
which has the full rank of $5$. 

















\section{Inverse Kinematics}

As we already know, the forward kinematics establishes the relationship between the joint variables and the position and orientation of the end effector. The problem of inverse kinematics is to find the joint variables when the position and orientation of the end effector is given. This is wanted because the wanted position or trajectory is given in the Cartesian world frame. Unfortunately the inverse kinematics problem is not as easy and straight forward as the forward kinematics problem. \cite{Siciliano} lists up several reasons the inverse kinematics problem is so much more complex:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The equations to solve are in general nonlinear, and thus it is not always possible to find a closed-form solution.
    \item Multiple solutions may exist.
    \item Infinite solutions may exist, e.g., in the case of a kinematically redundant manipulator.
    \item There might be no admissible solutions, in view of the manipulator kinematic structure.
\end{itemize}
There are different methods of solving the inverse kinematics problem. One way to solve it is to solve it algebraically. Ideally you want a function that has the orientation and position as input and then gives the respective joint angles. In our case where we have a 5 DOF robot arm the equations becomes too large and too difficult to solve, \cite{spong}. By looking at the equation $T_5^0=H$ where $T_5^0$ is given in \eqref{eq:T5} and $H$ is the desired transformation matrix of the end effector. It shows us that it gives a complex set of equations to solve. Another thing that must be consideres is that not all joints in our system can rotate 360 degrees either so if a solution is to be found it may not work because of the limitations of the robot manipulator. \\

It is also possible to use a geometric approach where the thought is to find the joint angels by projecting the manipulator onto the previous plane[\cite{spong}] and solve it using trigonometry. Both \cite{spong} and \cite{Siciliano} uses simple manipulators and special cases where simplifications can be made. \\

After some research in making a inverse kinematics solver from the bottom and up with constraints and everything, it was found that this will not yield satisfactory results. The choice was therefore to use an already existing solver. Many solvers did not support a 5 DOF robot manipulator, but after some research the choice fell upon a MATLAB robotics toolbox(https://se.mathworks.com/help/robotics/). The toolbox makes a great interface with ROS which makes it easy to create subscribers and listeners here as well. A useful part is that it is possible to include the URDF file where MATLAB creates a robot object and represent the robot manipulator as something called rigid body tree. In other words it is just the way MATLAB parses the URDF file. In \figref{fig:showRovs} the MATLAB function $show(robot)$ is used and you can see the visualization of the robot. This can be used to check solutions and it can be though as a simpler version of RViz.  

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{img/showRobs.eps}
  \caption{MATLAB visualization of the robot using URDF}
  \label{fig:showRovs}
\end{figure}

In \lstref{lst:robotinit} seen below the robot object is created. The inverse kinematics solver object is also created. The initial solver of the inverse kinematics problem is the \textit{Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno} (BFGS) algorithm which is an iterative, gradient-based optimization method that start with an initial guess to minimize a cost function \cite{MatlabRobTool}. The other solving algorith is the \textit{Levenberg-Marquardt} algorithm which is not as good if you only have the home configuration of the robot, but it is faster. So if you are to follow a path it could be a good choice to use \textit{Levenberg-Marquardt}. 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={MATLAB code of creating a invrerse kinematics},label={lst:robotinit},language=Matlab]
robot = importrobot('robot.urdf');
ik = robotics.GeneralizedInverseKinematics('RigidBodyTree',robot);
ik.ConstraintInputs={'joint','position','orientation'};
ik.SolverParameters.SolutionTolerance = 0.00001;
ik.SolverParameters.GradientTolerance = 0.000001;
ik.SolverParameters.MaxTime = 0.1;
ik.SolverParameters.AllowRandomRestart = 0;
\end{lstlisting}

The \lstref{lst:gik} show an example of finding the inverse kinematics. Here we want the end effector denoted 'right finger' which was moved to the center for a reference point, to reach the position $pd$ with the orientation $od$. It is also wanted to have some constraints such that the solution is at a feasible configuration which is seen at line 6 to 10. Again the datasheets does not state the operational limits of the joints 2,3 and 4, so the bounds has been guessed. The bounds of the twisting joints 1 and 5 are set to $\pm \pi$ to avoid solutions past these bounds. 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={MATLAB code of creating a inverse kinematics},label={lst:gik},language=Matlab]
posTgt = robotics.PositionTarget('right_finger');
posTgt.TargetPosition = pd';
orTgt = robotics.OrientationTarget('right_finger');
orTgt.TargetOrientation = eul2quat(od');
jointConst = robotics.JointPositionBounds(robot);

In \figref{fig:oath} a random path has been generated. It is inside the configuration space of the robot. The projection is also plotted to get a better feel of the 3D path. It was wanted to generate a circular motion such that it would start and end in the same point. Below in \lstref{lst:path} the process of generate this simple path is shown. The desired orientation in ZYX Euler angles is $o_d = [0,0,0]^T$ which in means that the desired orientation is up.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={MATLAB code for creating path},label={lst:path},language=Matlab]
t = 0:steplength:2*pi+steplength
xpath = 0.035*cos(t)+0.09;
ypath = 0.035*sin(t)+0.09;
zpath = 0.050*sin(t)+0.25;
path = [xpath;ypath;zpath];
\end{lstlisting}
In \figref{fig:compa} the generated path from \lstref{lst:path} and the calculated path from the inverse kinematics is plotted. Equation \eqref{eq:T5} was used to convert the joint paths to xyz coordinates in the world frame. The results is very good and the largest error is an error of $0.0092$ radians which corresponds to approximately $0.5$ degrees. The mean is $8.54\cdot10^{-6}$ radians.

In \figref{fig:outOC} some of the path is moved outside the configuration space of the robot and one can see that the solver makes the path at its best effort. It other words if given a path it will follow it until it goes out of the configuration space and then it will follow the path that mimimzes the cost function of the solver.

\begin{comment}


\cite{Siciliano} states that one can use the Jacobian of the system to calculate the inverse kinematics:

\begin{align}\label{eq:algo}
\dot{\bm{e}} = \dot{\bm{x}}_d - \bm{J}_A(\bm{q})\dot{\bm{q}}
\end{align}

In \figref{fig:inverseAlgo} the inverse kinematics algorithm is stated. From the figure one can see that 
$$
\dot{\bm{q}} = \bm{J}_A^{-1}(\bm{q})(\dot{\bm{x}}_d + \bm{K}e)
$$
where K is a positive definite diagonal matrix which makes the resulting system \eqref{eq:algo} into the linear system
\begin{align*}
    \dot{\bm{e}} + \bm{K}e = \bm{0}
\end{align*}


\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{img/inverseKin.png}
  \caption{Inverse kinematics algotihm with Jacobian inverse. Source \cite{Siciliano}.}
  \label{fig:inverseAlgo}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Analytical Jacobian}
To use the algorithm in \figref{fig:inverseAlgo} the analytical Jacobian is needed. In \cite{Siciliano} the following relationship is given
\begin{align*}
    \bm{J}_A =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \bm{I} & \bm{0}\\ 0 & \bm{T}^{-1}(\bm{\phi_e})
    \end{bmatrix}
    \bm{J}(\bm{q})
\end{align*}

where $\bm{\phi_e} = [\phi,\theta,\psi]^T$ is the orientation of the end-effector frame relative to the base frame given by the Euler angles ZYZ. From \eqref{eq:T5} the rotation matrix from the base frame to end-effector is
\begin{align*}
    \bm{R}_5^0 &= 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13}\\
        r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23}\\
        r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33}
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        c_1c_{234}c_5 - s_1s_5 & -s_1c_5 - c_1c_{234}s_5 & c_1s_{234}\\
        s_1c_{234}c_5 + c_1s_5 & c_1c_5 - s_1c_{234}s_5 & s_1s_{234}\\
        -s_{234}c_5 & s_{234}s_5 & c_{234} 
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

The ZYZ Euler angles are then


\begin{align*}
    \phi &= atan2(r_{21},r_{11}) = atan2(s_1c_{234}c_5 + c_1s_5,c_1c_{234}c_5 - s_1s_5)\\
    \theta &= atan2\left(-r_{31},-\sqrt{r_{32}^2+r_{33}^2}\right) = atan2\left(s_{234}c_5,-\sqrt{s_{234}s_5^2+c_{234}^2}\right)\\
    \psi &= atan2(r_{32},r_{33}) = atan2(s_{234}s_5,c_{234})
\end{align*}

The angular velocity $\bm{\omega}_e$ and $\bm{T}(\bm{\alpha})$ is given as

\begin{align*}
    \bm{\omega} = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & -s_\phi & c_\phi s_\theta\\
        0 & c_\phi & s_\phi s_\theta\\
        1 & 0 & c_\theta
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \dot{\phi}\\\dot{\theta}\\\dot{\psi}
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \bm{T}(\bm{\phi}_e)\dot{\bm{\phi}}_e
\end{align*}
The determinant of $\bm{T}$ is $-s_\theta$ which means that one cannot invert for $\theta = 0,\pi$. This singularity is also the singularity of the geometric Jacobian. 








\section{Motion planning}




If the desired position is $p$ and the desired orientation is $R$. Then in \cite{Kinematics}, the inverse kinematics are given as: 

\begin{align*}
    q_1 &= \tan^{-1}{\left(\frac{p_y}{p_x}\right)}\\
    q_2 &= atan2\left( a(a_2+a_3c_3) - ba_3s_3, aa_3s_3 + b(a_2+a_3c_3) \right)\\%atan2
    q_3 &= \cos^{-1}{\left(\frac{a^2+b^2-a^2_2-a^2_3}{2a_2a_3}\right)}\\
    q_4 &= q_{234} - q_2 - q_3\\
    q_5 &= c_{234}q_1-2atan(R_{21},R_{11})
\end{align*}

where $a = d_1 - d_5c_{234}-p_z$, $b = p_xc_1 + p_ys_1+d_5s_{234}$ and $-\frac{\pi}{2}<q_1 < \frac{\pi}{2}$. $q_{234} = atan2\left(\frac{p_x}{c_1p_x+s_1p_y})\right)$
