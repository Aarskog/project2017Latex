In this project a five degrees of freedom robot manipulator is considered. The goal is to make a virtual model of it and be able to place it in a simulation environment where testing of controllers and motion planning algorithms is easy and safe compared to testing it on the real manipulator. The forward and inverse kinematics problem is also addressed and a solution is proposed. The last topic is basic motion planning including finding a path with an obstacle present, along with basic trajectory planning.
