In this project a five degrees of freedom robot manipulator is given. It is wanted to make a virtual model of it and be able to place it in a simulation environment where testing of controllers and motion planning algorithms is easy and safe compared to testing it on the real manipulator. The forward and inverse kinematics problem is also visited and a solution is proposed. The last topic is some basic motion planning including finding a path with an obstacle present along with some basis trajectory planning. %
